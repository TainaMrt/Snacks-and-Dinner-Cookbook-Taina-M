  <h3>INGREDIENTS NEEDED:</h3>   
    <ul>
      <li> 1 1/2 sticks of unsalted butter </li>
      <li> Two 10-oz bags of mini marshmallows</li>
      <li> 3/4 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
      <li> 1/2 tsp of salt </li>
      <li> 8 1/2 cups of Rice Krispies cereal</li>
        </ul>

   <ol>
     <li> First, line a 9 by 13 baking pan in aluminum foil and then lightly grease the pan with melted/softened butter. Be sure to set aside 2 cups of marshmallows for later.  </li>
      <li> Using a pot, melt your butter over medium/light heat and occasionally stir the butter to be sure that the butter isn't burning. When the butter starts to turn a golden brown and you begin to smell a nutty, chocolatey sort of scent take your pot off the stove. </li>
      <li> Add in your vanilla extract, your sugar, your marshmallows, and your salt.</li>
      <li> Put your pot back on the stove and stir everything in thoroughly. (Most preferably with a wooden spoon, but just use a spoon that won't melt when in contact with heat.) Be sure that the marshmallows are completely melted. </li>
      <li> Remove your pot from the stove and add the cereal into the mixture. Stir everything in completely.<</li>
      <li>Add in the reserved marshmallows and stir only until partially melted. Transfer the mixture to the pan you prepared earlier and spread the mixture out evenly. </li>
     <li>Leave the treats to cool for about an hour, then cut into small squares and enjoy!</li>
   </ol>
